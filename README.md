### Source of Knowledge
My main knowledge comes from the documentation of individual libraries. In the process of learning (started some time ago) I also read two books: *C++ Primer 5th edition* and *SFML Game Development.* I also get a lot of help from the official SFML forum. There are many helpful threads there.
